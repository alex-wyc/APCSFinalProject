		<h1> Project Lucifer </h1>
		<h2>Entry #1</h2>
		<p><font color="red">It has been a while since the we left Earth and the old world behind.
		Apparently this settlement, called Project Janus, is an effort
		to escape from the political quandry that limited scientific
		growth in the old world. This settlement is pretty much
		egalitarian and made up almost entirely of scientists, engineers
		and technicians. I like this enviroment, I call it "mega-academia"
		and like many here, believe that this system should be used on
		a larger extent.</font></p>

				<li>ORDERED ONE</li>
				<li>ORDERED TWO</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
		<p>My job here as a scientist is dark-energy research. I hope it would
		shed new light on the origin of the universe as well as some potential
		energy resources. I'll keep this log as a type of personal reflection
		and documentation on the achievement and/or failures of the project.
		Whether this project succeeds or fails is beyond my control, but
		I do hope this log may be some help to me or later generations.</p>
