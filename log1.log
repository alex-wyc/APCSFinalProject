Now we need to decide how the class hierarchy will work

1. We need a special formatting class that'll take in elements and append ANSI code before and after it to have the correct formatting
2. We need a script class that'll take in javascript and turn them into executable java (i.e. a running JS. platform)
3. We need a connector class to go to websites (This is the socket blah blah blah thing)


Currently let's work on 1 and 2

Name for 1: Format.java
Name for 2: JSRunner.java
Name for 3: Connector.java


Name for main interface: Driver.java


Since I am completely clueless to GUI programming, can you write the Driver.java?


Definitely, we should use this, b/c websites have images, and loading images in java is hell

Ok good, i'll work on Format.java now

Now get to work!!
